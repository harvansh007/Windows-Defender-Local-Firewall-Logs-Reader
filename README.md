# Windows-Defender-Local-Firewall-Logs-Reader

Hi 👋, I'm Harvansh Singh
Wellcome to my "Windows-Defender-Local-Firewall-Logs-Reader"

As a Defender engineer, you know how challenging it can be to read and interpret local Defender firewall logs.
To address this, I have developed a tool that simplifies the process of analyzing firewall logs from both local and remote devices. The tool also converts the logs into a clear, user-friendly format for better understanding.

Pre-requisites : Administrator access is required to collect log files.

Features
Collect Domain Firewall logs.
Collect Private Firewall logs.
Collect Public Firewall logs.
Search and filter data within a table.
Copy log files with a single button.
Clear the table with a button.
